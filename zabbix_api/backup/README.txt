Zabbix Backup Scripts
	This folder contains Python scripts designed to back up various Zabbix configurations, such as host groups, inventory details, and tags. 
	The scripts use the Zabbix API to extract and save this information.

Folder Contents

save_groups.py
	This script backs up the Zabbix host groups. It fetches all groups and saves them to a specified file in a structured format.

save_inv.py
	This script retrieves and backs up the inventory data of hosts from Zabbix. It can be used to save detailed inventory information to a file for later use.

save_tags.py
	This script backs up the tags associated with various entities in Zabbix. Tags are useful for categorizing and filtering resources within Zabbix, and this script ensures they are 	saved for reference or restoration.

Usage
	Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Typically, you need the zabbix-api Python library:

	bash
		pip install zabbix-api
	Configure the Zabbix server connection details (e.g., URL, username, and password) within each script.

	Run the scripts individually from the command line:

	bash
		python save_groups.py
		python save_inv.py
		python save_tags.py
	Each script outputs the retrieved data to a structured file, making it easier to restore configurations if needed.

Requirements
	Python 3.x
	Zabbix API library (zabbix-api)
