Zabbix API library: Install using pip install zabbix-api
PySNMP library (required for SNMP scripts): Install using pip install pysnmp
Scripts Overview
1. change_vlan_group.py
This script changes the VLAN group of specified hosts. It reads host names from a file and updates their VLAN group based on predefined settings.

2. get_script_id.py
A utility script to retrieve the script ID of a given Zabbix script by name. This is useful when you need the script ID for automation tasks.

3. pdu_power_cycle_ha.py
This script performs a power cycle operation for high-availability PDUs based on their SNMP data. It uses the pysnmp library to interact with PDUs and trigger the power cycle.

4. set_pdu_tag.py
The script assigns tags to PDUs based on their vendor information retrieved via SNMP. It checks the PDUâ€™s details, identifies the vendor, and tags them accordingly in Zabbix.

5. update_inv.py
This script updates the inventory information of hosts. It is designed to fetch relevant inventory data and update it using the Zabbix API.

6. zab_read_tags.py
A script to read and display tags of specified Zabbix hosts. The tags are retrieved and printed for each host listed in a text file.

7. zab_set_tags.py
This script updates tags for hosts in Zabbix. It reads host names from a file and sets the tags based on predefined criteria or information from another file.

8. zab_set_tags2.py
An enhanced version of zab_set_tags.py, offering additional features like handling multiple tag formats or supporting more complex tagging logic.
